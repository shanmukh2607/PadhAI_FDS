Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods
processes algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from
structured and unstructured data Data science is related to data
mining and big data. Data science is a concept to
unify statistics data analysis machine learning and their related methods
in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data
It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within
the context of mathematics statistics computer science and information science
Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a
fourth paradigm of science empirical theoretical computational and now data
driven and asserted that everything about science is changing because
of the impact of information technology and the data deluge
In 2015 the American Statistical Association identified database management statistics
and machine learning and distributed and parallel systems as the
